        "\n",
        "- Memory Leaks from Circular References:\n",
        "Python's primary memory management mechanism, reference counting, cannot detect and free objects involved in circular references. This occurs when two or more objects reference each other, forming a cycle, even if no other parts of the program reference them. The cyclic garbage collector addresses this, but it adds overhead.\n",
        "- High Memory Consumption:\n",
        "Compared to languages with manual memory management, Python can consume more memory. This is partly due to its object-oriented nature, where everything is an object, and the overhead associated with storing reference counts and other metadata.\n",
        "- Performance Overhead of Garbage Collection:\n",
        "While automatic, the garbage collection process, especially for cyclic references, can introduce performance overhead, particularly in memory-intensive applications or when dealing with large datasets. The timing of garbage collection can also be unpredictable, potentially causing pauses in execution."
